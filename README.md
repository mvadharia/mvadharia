 - I'm a software engineer over 2.5 years of experience who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Java Backend Microservices and Angular frontend services (JavaScript, API, Job Schedulers ) . I have implemented various common reusable libraries, custom components(backend and frontend) along with efficient Rest API
and Pub-Sub classes for data transfer between systems.
